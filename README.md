# Financial Macro Indicator Analysis

This project is focused on the analysis of financial macroeconomic indicators to identify economic regimes such as contraction, recovery, expansion, and slowdown. It leverages various data analysis and techniques to achieve this.


Data Retrieval: The project retrieves financial macroeconomic indicators, including interest rates, permits, and market volatility, from online sources using tools like pandas and data readers.

Data Transformation: It employs data transformation techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and L1 Trend Filtering, to process and prepare the indicator data for analysis.

Regime Identification: The project identifies economic regimes by analyzing trends and momentum in the data. This classification is critical for understanding the economic environment.

Visualization: The project creates visualizations, including charts, to illustrate the transformed macroeconomic indicators, the L1 trend filtering results, and the identified economic regimes.
